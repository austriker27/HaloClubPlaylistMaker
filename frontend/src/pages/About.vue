        <h1>About Woodinville Halofest</h1>
        <p>It all started many moons ago in a land not named Woodinville. Since then we've tried to hold yearly halofests for anyone interested in playing. We channel the spirit of the original LAN parties via Halo Masterchief Collection and often play Hlao 2 and Halo 3 accompanied by pizza and drinks that make us stay up too late..</p>
