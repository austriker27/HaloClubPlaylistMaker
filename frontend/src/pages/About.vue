        <p class="my-2">It all started many moons ago in a land not named Woodinville. Since then we've tried to hold yearly halofests for anyone interested in playing. We channel the spirit of the original LAN parties via Halo Masterchief Collection and mostly play Halo 2 and Halo 3 via MCC accompanied by pizza and drinks that make us stay up too late..</p>
        <p class="my-2">All are welcome to join! Come play and lets bring it back to the 2000s!</p>
